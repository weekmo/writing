\chapter{Results}
\hspace{2em}After implementing non-rigid ICP, we test the tools we have developed to assess the algorithm. We use data collected from \textbf{\textit{Human Connectome Projects}} \cite{CCF}. The number of samples used for testing is four with eleven pathways (bundles) in each side of the brain. We present two experiments to show how the method works from the same patient. The first experiment is left and right side of the same pathway and the second one is for one pathway, which deformed and re-registered again with the original shape.

\section{DIPY registration Method}
We compare our tools with a registration method discussed in \cite{Garyfallidis2015} and implemented in \textit{DIPY} package.

The method starts by reducing the number of points in each tract to a certain number of point, which is necessary for the method to have the same number of points in each tract.

DIPY method gets the initial orientation by placing both bundles (streamlines) in the origin point of the 3D Euclidean space. In this case, it considers only translation but not other transformations. To solve this problem and to be fare on the comparison, we use PCA tool that we develop to get the initial alignment before applying the DIPY method.

DIPY calculate the distance between template bundle and target bundle using a function called \textit{minimum average direct-flip distance (MDF)}. MDF is asymmetric
distance function, which can be applied only when all tracts have the same number of points, that is one reason why we reduce the number of point before applying DIPY registration, another reason is increasing the speed of distance calculation \cite{Garyfallidis2012}.

The method then uses optimizer to select the best combination of variables, which later converted to affine matrix, while reducing the overall distance between template bundle.

\section{Testing steps}
\begin{itemize}
\item Read bundles from \textit{ply} files
\item Apply PCA and visually inspect the alignment result
\item If the visual inspection was positive and PCA improved the alignment, we consider its result, otherwise we just flip the template bundle or consider the original orientation
\item Generate distances histogram between two bundles to select the distance threshold
\item Start the registration and iterate until there is no more improvement on the alignment
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment Result (1)}
\hspace{2em}In this experiment we use both side of Thalamic Radiation (ATR) fiber pathway, whereas the template bundle is the ATR on the right side and the target bundle is the left side of the ATR from the same patient.

\label{fig:hist_PCA}
\end{figure}


First, we read the data (left and right side of ATR) using a tool that we customized from \textit{PlyFile} package to suit our data. Then we apply PCA and visually inspect the result as shown in Figures \ref{fig:img_original} and \ref{fig:img_PCA}. If PCA improves the alignment, we consider its result, otherwise we accept the original orientation or just flip the template bundle if two bundles are from different side of the brain.

As we can see the result in Figure \ref{fig:img_PCA}, the PCA tool improved the alignment and it also reduced the distance between two bundles as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hist_PCA} and Figure \ref{fig:hist_original}, so we consider the result as initial alignment for the registration.

The next step is choosing the threshold, which determines the values of the weight matrix $W$ as discussed in the chapter \textit{Methods and Implementation}. The value  is \textit{one} if the distance between pint in template bundle and the correspondent point in target bundle is less than the threshold, otherwise it is \textit{one}. 

To choose the threshold we need to know the frequency of distances, therefore, we generate a histogram as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hist_PCA}. This experiment we decide to choose the value of the threshold to be seven, in this case, around ninety eight percent 98\% of points will have weight equal \textit{one} in the weight matrix $W$ and the remaining will be \textit{zeros}.

Now we need to choose the stiffness weight $\alpha$, which is not trivial, it comes after observing the visual output of the registration. If the template bundle strongly deformed and it is about to map to target bundle, then we increase the value of $\alpha$ and vice versa. In this experiment we decide the optimal value of $\alpha$ is 9999.

After we have the initial alignment using PCA and the parameters values, we register two bundles (template and target) using our tool and then DIPY registration function to compare the results. The visual results presented in Figure \ref{fig:img_ICP} and Figure \ref{fig:img_dipy} show that our tool has better registration and can deform the shape of the template bundle.

We also generate distances histograms to compare the reduction on overall distance between two methods, see Figure \ref{fig:hist_ICP} and Figure \ref{fig:hist_dipy}. We want to mention that LSQR function return acond equal \textit{100000531}, which is average of tree time calculation of LSQR as we mention in the chapter \textit{Methods and Implementation}.

\section{Experiment Result (2)}
The second experiment is testing how the method can correct the deformation. Therefore, we take the right side of ATR and deform its shape locally (local transformation). Essentially, what we mean by local transformation is that we apply different affine transformation matrices for each point in the bundle. Then we register the deformed bundle with the original copy (before deformation) using our tool and then DIPY. As we can see in Figures \ref{fig:hist_icp_def}, our tool can correct the deformation appropriately. DIPY can give optimal alignment but it can not correct the deformation. The return value average of acond equal \textbf{5741672}

\end{figure}

Finally, we found that our tool can handle the deformation easily (elastic registration) but \textit{DIPY} can only handle the size by scaling the template bundles.

The \textit{DIPY} method is much faster than our method because it is implemented to reduce the number of points used to calculate the distance. In our test, each tract reduced to 20 points rather than the real number of points as shown in table \ref{table:data}. Furthermore, as mentioned in \cite{Garyfallidis2012}, \textit{DIPY} uses a minimum average direct-flip distance (MDF) which considers the tract to tract distance whereas our tool considers the point to point distance. To improve our tool, hierarchical clustering bundles can be done and soft membership alignment can be applied.
