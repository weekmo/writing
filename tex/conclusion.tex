\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis non-rigid ICP registration method that illustrated in \cite{Amberg2007} was discussed, customized and implemented to fit the brain pathways data which considered as challenging registration problem. 

The tool developed here was tested using real brain pathways data from patients from \textbf{\textit{UKB Universit√§tsklinikum Bonn}}. The images were taken by MRI technology and converted to 3D coordinate. The tool can handle the deformation and sign affine matrix for each vertex to optimally align overall pathway.

The performance of the tool can be improved by applying hierarchical clustering and apply soft membership to vertices depending on the central clusters points.

Applying PCA sometimes does not find the right orientation of bundles
