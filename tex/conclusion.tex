\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis non-rigid ICP registration method that illustrated in \cite{Amberg2007} was discussed, customized and implemented to fit the brain pathways data which considered as challenging registration problem.

The tool developed here was tested using real brain pathways data from patients from \textbf{\textit{UKB Universit√§tsklinikum Bonn}}.

- Images were taken by MRI technology and converted to 3D coordinate.\\
- The tool can handle the deformation\\
- the performance need to be improved\\
- PCA sometimes doesn't find the right orientation\\
